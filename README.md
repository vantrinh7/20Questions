# 20 Questions Game

This program is a simple version of the 20Q (20 Questions) game invented by Robin Burgener in 1988. The game asks the player to think of a subject, asks a series of Yes/No questions and then guesses the identity of the subject. The game utilizes neural-network-based artificial intelligence to produce the answer and is able to improve over time by learning from its interactions with the player. 

In this simplified version of the game, the program gives player a small list of options, asks Yes/No questions and then presents a possible guess based on player's answer.
